## Description

Project status: 11.06.2022

The map Hydrogeological Overview Map of Germany 1:250,000 (HÜK250) describes the hydrogeological characteristics of the upper, large-scale contiguous aquifers in Germany that are generally used for water management purposes.

The HÜK250 is a joint project of the State Geological Services (SGD) under the leadership of the BGR, which was launched in 2000. The reason for this was and is the need to provide digitally coordinated hydrogeological information for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD) across all German states. The first version was developed in just three years. The basis for this was the geological information on lithology, stratigraphy and genesis of the digitally available 1:200,000 geological overview map (GÜK200) as well as the federal states' own geological and hydrogeological maps, which were hydrogeologically interpreted and reattributed with the help of the regional expertise of the SGD. At the end of 2006, version 2, which had been further developed and supplemented in terms of content and technology, became available, containing in particular a newly designed database and a standardized nationwide general legend. Version 3, which does not require a map sheet, was revised and harmonized in terms of geometry and content at the original map sheet and national boundaries. In the course of a Europe-wide harmonization of map series, the new version was published in 2019.

Seven hydrogeological attributes are recorded:
- Permeability
- Geochemical rock type
- Rock type
- Cavity type
- Consolidation
- Lithology
- Stratigraphy
